    <h3>GAME OVERVIEW</h3>

    <h4>Map</h4>

    <p> The game will take place on a 2D tile map with edges simulating a university campus. The setting of the map can be realistic 
        or fantasy. For this initial game version, one will be created, with possible additions in the future. In this minimal viable 
        product, the map will not be extendable. The player can place infrastructure elements within the map's limits, but natural 
        elements will prohibit building placement. Players can utilise natural features to maximise student satisfaction (e.g., placing 
        a connection between 2 buildings near a lake to enhance campus aesthetics), while other elements (e.g., a hill) will provide 
        no direct benefit and must be worked around.
        The map will contain multiple terrain types, such as grassland, overgrown 
        grassland, woodland, trees, lake, river, road, pavement, rocky terrain, hills, urban area, gravel and brushland.
    <h4>Timer</h4>

    <p> The timer will be start paused to allow the first-time player to familiarise themselves with the game interface and mechanics. 
        A short tutorial will be displayed during this time. Once the player is ready, they will press 'start', which will begin the 
        5-minute timer, representing 3 years of in-game time.
    </p>

    <h4>Buildings</h4>
       
    <p> Buildings play a crucial role in the game as they will be the player's primary way of increasing student satisfaction. 
        Different buildings will offer different benefits that will increase student satisfaction. Constructing them will be the primary way for the player to 
        spend their money and the construction times must be taken into consideration as they can have a negative impact on student 
        satisfaction if they are placed near a library (noisy) or can cause accidents if placed near recreation areas.
        Here's a non-exhaustive list of buildings for each type that will be available for construction:
    </p>
        <table border="1">
            <tr>
              <th>Lessons</th>
              <th>Study</th>
              <th>Food</th>
              <th>Events</th>
              <th>Accommodation</th>
              <th>Infrastructure</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Lecture hall</td>
              <td>Library</td>
              <td>Restaurant</td>
              <td>Event hall</td>
              <td>Student hall</td>
              <td>Road</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Laboratory</td>
              <td>Study room</td>
              <td>Cafeteria</td>
              <td>Common room</td>
              <td>Student houses</td>
              <td>Pavement</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td></td>
              <td></td>
              <td>Vending Machine</td>
              <td></td>
              <td></td>
              <td>Bridge</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h4>Counter</h4>

        <p> A counter will be an integral part of the game interface. Its primary function is to track the number of each building 
            type present on the campus. It will act as a guide to the player to balance the number of each type to achieve optimal 
            student satisfaction - for some building types, only one instance is needed or permitted, while for others, the player 
            will have the flexibility in determining how many they will construct.
        
        <h4>Events</h4>

        <p> Throughout the game, random events will occur based on the map's environment. 
            If the campus is set on earth, these events should be realistic whereas in more fantastical settings 
            like another planet or space station more variety will be allowed. As the game progresses, the frequency 
            and complexity of the events will increase. This gives the player some time to learn the game mechanics. 
            Later in the game, the event significance will increase. These events will be more challenging to manage and it 
            won't always be immediately clear to the player how to respond. There will be some events that are “neutral” - meaning 
            they do not directly impact student satisfaction. However, they will present to the player with options to react, 
            and the choices they make may lead to negative effects on the student satisfaction.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Complex events:</h4> 

        <p> Intricate events with not obvious handling - reacting a certain way may decrease satisfaction in the short term but increase 
            in the long term. The player must consider the possible effects of the events and act accordingly.
            Below is a list of potential events that can occur during gameplay: 
        </p>
    
        <table border="1">
            <tr>
                <th>Positive Events</th>
                <th>Negative Events</th>
                <th>Neutral Events</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sunny weather
                <td>Storms</td>
                <td>Tree planting campaign</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Celebrity guest lecture</td>
                <td>Drunk students & Bullying</td>
                <td>Campus store has flash sale</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Social (party, sports or art event)</td>
              <td>Government budget cuts</td>
              <td>Faculty debate</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Green campus initiative</td>
                <td>Student protest</td>
                <td>Cafeteria menu change</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Local business sponsorship</td>
                <td>Staff strike</td>
                <td>Uni sport team champions</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Invisible donor</td>
                <td>Contaminated restaurant food</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h4> Resources & Student Satisfaction </h4>

        <p> The player will start with an initial sum of money which they must wisely invest to maximise student satisfaction. Another key resource will be the number of staff who require money to employ but contribute to improving student satisfaction.
            The final score of each game is determined by the level of student satisfaction achieved.  It is displayed at the end of the game along with a complimentary message indicating the player's overall performance. The student satisfaction bar should be prominently placed in the screen for clear visibility to the player.
        </p>

        <h4> Difficulty Levels </h4>

        <p> The player will be able to choose between three difficulty modes (easy, moderate, hard), On easy mode the gameplay should be fun and relaxing, with more positive events occurring more frequently. More resources will be available, less maintenance will be required and achieving a high student satisfaction will be easier. On hard mode, negative events will happen often and their impact will be much greater if the player does not take appropriate action. Moreover, some otherwise neutral events in easy and moderate modes, will have an impact in this mode. Moderate mode will strike a balance between easy and hard, offering a more challenging experience than easy mode but less punishing than hard mode. In general, the game should provide a pleasant experience to players with an overall easy gameplay.
