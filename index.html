    <h1> UniSim</h1>
    <p> UniSim is a single player simulation game where players are tasked with building and managing a university campus. The goal of the game is to achieve maximum student satisfaction score by the end of the time. 
    The player begins with an empty map and are offered options to construct several buildings which cannot be altered after. Once the game begins, the player must use their resources available to them wisely to achieve the best student satisfaction possible by striking a balance between different factors. These factors include but are not limited to: building types, building proximity to relevant facilities, building and infrastructure maintenance, links between campus areas, strategic placement of natural elements. 
    The player is presented with special events that occur randomly. The events may be positive, negative or have no impact based on the players reaction (or non-reaction). The player must decide how to allocate and acquire resources during the game to achieve the best outcome.
    The game has a time limit of 5 minutes, then the game stops and the score is displayed as well as a complementary message reflecting performance. While the game cannot be “failed”, the message will indicate how well the player did.
    It is assumed that players will have basic familiarity with simulation games and how game interfaces work. A short tutorial or interface explanations should be provided highlighting certain aspects of the game in the beginning.
